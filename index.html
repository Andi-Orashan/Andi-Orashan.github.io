<h1>Instagram Influencer Data Analysis Reflection By Andi Orashan</h1>
<p>In recent years, being a social media influencer has become a more popular "job" choice. Whether it be through Instagram, Tiktok or some other platform, people want to know what makes an influencer more popular.
Well, I have found data about Instagram Influencers on Kaggle and I have done an analysis in order to answer that question. I have seperated the previous question into four seperate questions in order to better determine what affects an influencers popularity.
These four questions determine if there is a statistically significant correlation between an influencers score and their amount of followers, their average likes, their total likes or their amount of posts. 




imported the data into Jupyter Notebook and used Python, Pandas and Seaborn to draw conclusions. I started by removing any missing data points and groups of data that I didn't need.
I used the Pandas Library of code to find statistical data, graph data and determine the correlation between the data types. I found that there was no statistically significant correlation between any of the data.
